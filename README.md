# ML Data Analysis Project

This project demonstrates a Machine Learning pipeline for data pre-processing, data visualization, and model creation using a **Random Forest Classifier**. It focuses on cleaning and preparing a dataset, followed by visualizations, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:
- Load and pre-process a dataset.
- Handle missing values using imputation techniques.
- Visualize the relationships between features.
- Build and evaluate a machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier).
- Display feature importances for better understanding of the dataset.

## Files in this Repository

- 'main.ipynb' - Contains the complete pipeline for data pre-processing, data visualization, and model training.
- `dataset.txt` - The dataset used in this project for training and testing the machine learning model.
- `README.md` - This file, providing an overview and instructions for running the project.


## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- **pandas**: for data manipulation
- **seaborn**: for data visualization
- **matplotlib**: for plotting graphs
- **scikit-learn**: for machine learning models and evaluation

You can install all dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
